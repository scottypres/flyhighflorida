<section id="general-questions">
    <h2>General Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="training-structure">What is the structure of the training program?</h3>
    <p>Powered paragliding training at Palm Beach Paramotor occurs in 3 phases: Ground school, kiting, and motor training.</p>
    <h3 id="training-duration">How long does it take?</h3>
    <p>You are guaranteed at least 10 sessions in your training package. Everyone learns at their own pace, but some students can expect to be airborne and solo by day 3 or 4.</p>
    <h3 id="age-limit">I’m over 60 years old. Am I too old for this sport?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely not! Students as young as 14 and as old as 80 have trained to fly paramotors. If you can jog a short distance, you can do this!</p>
    <h3 id="weight-limits">What are the weight limits for powered paragliding?</h3>
    <p>There is theoretically no weight limit to train or fly power paragliders. When I began my training, I was turned away from a few well-known training schools due to my weight of 260 lbs. For this reason, our doors are open to pilots up to 300 lbs, so as not to exclude any prospective students! There is gear suitable for all size pilots.</p>
</section>

<section id="equipment-questions">
    <h2>Equipment-Related Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="gear-purchase">Will I need to purchase my own gear?</h3>
    <p>No. In fact, we encourage you to wait until you’ve completed training to purchase gear. All gear is provided to you during your training with Palm Beach Paramotor. When you are ready to purchase gear, you will be a proficient pilot ready to fly on your brand-new gear.</p>
    <h3 id="trike-or-foot-launch">Should I train for trike or foot-launch?</h3>
    <p>This comes down to personal preference, the type of flying you intend to do, and your physical fitness level. For students who struggle with mobility, trike is a great option! Foot-launch and trike both have pros and cons. We can discuss this further during your introductory tandem flight.</p>
    <h3 id="transportation">How do I transport my paramotor and wing?</h3>
    <p>Most modern paramotors are designed to be disassembled in just a few minutes, allowing them to fit easily into most SUVs and many crossover and small cars. Alternatively, some pilots prefer to keep their paramotor fully assembled and transport it in a truck bed or on a hitch carrier. The wing is made of highly compressible fabric and can be packed down to about the size of carry-on luggage, making transportation simple and convenient.</p>
</section>

<section id="cost-training-details">
    <h2>Cost and Training Details</h2>
    <h3 id="not-ready-to-fly">What happens if I don’t feel ready to fly after completing the training?</h3>
    <p>Training is designed to progress at your own pace, whether that’s 5 consecutive days or spread out over weekends across 2-3 months. The most important factor in your success is wing handling, and practicing kiting at home between sessions will significantly improve your skills and readiness. While it’s rare for students to feel unprepared to fly after completing their training, additional sessions are available if needed. These sessions are $300 each and typically last 2-3 hours, scheduled in the mornings or evenings to provide optimal learning conditions. My goal is to ensure you feel confident and safe when you take to the skies!</p>
</section>

<section id="flying-maintenance">
    <h2>Flying and Maintenance Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="flight-height-distance">How high and how far can you fly with a powered paraglider?</h3>
    <p>Powered paragliders can legally fly up to 18,000 feet, where Class A restricted airspace begins. However, most pilots prefer to stay under 500 feet, as it offers the best experience for enjoying the scenery. While high-altitude flights are possible, oxygen saturation and temperature become a concern well below 18,000 feet, so staying far lower is more comfortable and practical for most flights.</p>
    <h3 id="safe-weather">What kind of weather conditions are safest for flying?</h3>
    <p>The safest flying conditions for powered paragliding include calm winds under 10 mph, clear skies, and little to no turbulence. Early mornings and late afternoons are typically the best times to fly, as the air is smoother and more stable. We avoid flying in strong winds, gusty conditions, rain, and thunderstorms. Understanding weather patterns is a crucial part of training, and we’ll teach you how to assess conditions to ensure a safe and enjoyable flight.</p>
    <h3 id="motor-out">What happens if the motor stops working mid-flight?</h3>
    <p>Powered paragliders (PPG) are uniquely safe in the event of a motor-out due to their slow flight speeds (15-30 mph) and ability to land in small open areas. PPG wings are stable and predictable without engine power, allowing for controlled descents with a glide ratio of 5:1 to 10:1. Most pilots routinely practice and even prefer landing with the motor off, demonstrating how forgiving and manageable the system is. In contrast, faster aircraft rely heavily on their engines and require longer runways, making engine failures more critical. PPG’s simplicity and design make it a safer option in motor-out scenarios.</p>
</section>

<section id="safety-questions">
    <h2>Safety Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="safety">How safe is powered paragliding?</h3>
    <p>Powered paragliding (PPG) is one of the safest forms of motorized aviation, with an estimated fatality rate of approximately 1 in 10,000 flights, making it about 5–10 times safer than motorcycle riding, which has a fatality rate of 58.33 per 100,000 riders annually in the U.S. Unlike motorcycles, where collisions with other vehicles are a significant risk, PPG pilots enjoy the freedom of open skies, greatly reducing the chance of collisions. With proper training, reliable equipment, and smart weather decisions, PPG offers a thrilling and safe way to experience flight.</p>
    <h3 id="fear-of-heights">What happens if I have a fear of heights?</h3>
    <p>Having a fear of unsecured heights is common, and even I experience it when walking along a cliff's edge or standing in a hot air balloon without being strapped in. Powered paragliding, however, feels completely different. The multi-point harness securely attaches you to the wing and motor, providing a safe and stable feeling. Since you’re seated and not directly connected to the ground, it feels more like floating in a chair than being exposed at a height. Many people with a fear of heights discover that PPG is something they can enjoy comfortably and confidently.</p>
    <h3 id="safety-measures">What safety measures are in place during training?</h3>
    <p>Safety is our top priority during powered paragliding training. You’ll begin with ground school to master wing handling and understand the equipment before moving on to controlled, low-altitude flights. All flights are conducted in ideal weather conditions, and I provide real-time guidance via a radio system. You’ll be flying an EN-A rated glider, which is the safest classification available, designed for maximum stability and forgiveness. Additionally, the multi-point harness ensures you're securely attached at all times, and all equipment is thoroughly inspected before each session. These measures ensure you build skills and confidence in a safe, step-by-step process.</p>
</section>

<section id="community-questions">
    <h2>Community Questions</h2>
    <h3 id="passenger-training">Can I fly with a passenger, and if so, do I need additional training?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can fly with a passenger, but in the U.S., you must obtain a tandem exemption from the FAA, which requires completing a tandem training program. This ensures you have the skills and knowledge to safely share the sky with a passenger.</p>
    <h3 id="community">Is there a community of pilots nearby I can join?</h3>
    <p>Power paragliding pilots are a niche community. Facebook groups are a great place to meet new pilots. I will be happy to connect you with pilots local to your area. Connecting with other PPG pilots in your area enhances safety, provides valuable insights about local flying conditions, and fosters camaraderie through group flights and shared experiences.</p>
